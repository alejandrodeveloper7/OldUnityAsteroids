# OldUnityAsteroids

-UI and cards images are from the asset store.<br>
-I have use several hours of the Thursday to look for the assets, sounds, font, planiffying the architecture, the scriptableobjects structure, the ui and similar preproduction tasks.<br>
-I have used 8 hours and half hour for dinner the Friday and and 6 hours with half hour for dinner the Saturday. Like I used some hours the Thrusday for preproduction y prefer donÂ´t do more changes. <br>
-Is not tested in iOS.<br>
<br>
<br>
With more time I would like:<br>
<br>
-Improve some code parts like use an index in the cards, to in each move, update only the data of that Cards instead upload all the board data.<br>
-Combine the 2 pools class in inheritance.<br>
-Improve the ControllerBase and ViewBase scripts.<br>
-Do it beutifull, is ugly right now.<br>
-Do the main menu UI dinamyc with vertical layoutGroup to addapt the height based on the used space.<br>
-Add logs in the code for easy debug.<br>
-Do the grid Gameobject a prefab instanced from the BoardManager with the size defined in the scriptableSettings for can instance a board in any place instead use a scene.<br>
