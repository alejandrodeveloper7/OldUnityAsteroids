# OldUnityAsteroids

-UI and cards images are from the asset store.
-I have use several hours of the Thursday to look for the assets, sounds, font, planiffying the architecture, the scriptableobjects structure, the ui and similar preproduction tasks.
-I have used 8 hours and half hour for dinner the Friday and and 6 hours with half hour for dinner the Saturday. Like I used some hours the Thrusday for preproduction y prefer donÂ´t do more changes. 


With more time I would like:

-Improve some code parts like use an index in the cards, to in each move, update only the data of that Cards instead upload all the board data
-Combine the 2 pools class in inheritance
-Improve the ControllerBase and ViewBase scripts.
-Do it beutifull, is ugly right now
-Do the main menu UI dinamyc with vertical layoutGroup to addapt the height based on the used space.
-Add logs in the code for easy debug
-Do the grid Gameobject a prefab instanced from the BoardManager with the size defined in the scriptableSettings for can instance a board in any place instead use a scene
